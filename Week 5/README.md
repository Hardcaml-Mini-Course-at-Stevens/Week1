# Week 5 Materials

* Please refer to the Week 5 powerpoint for various instructions including a reminder to update your local version of Hardcaml
* Brief description of the various example projects:
   * [Seqeunce Detector](https://github.com/Hardcaml-Mini-Course-at-Stevens/Course-Materials/tree/main/Week%205/SequenceDetectorFSM) - Generally simple application of a finite state machine to recognize a short sequence
   * [Traffic Light](https://github.com/Hardcaml-Mini-Course-at-Stevens/Course-Materials/tree/main/Week%205/TrafficLightFSM) - Generally simple application of a finite state machine to behave like a condensed version of a traffic light controller
   * [Display Demo](https://github.com/Hardcaml-Mini-Course-at-Stevens/Course-Materials/tree/main/Week%205/DisplayDemo) - Displays the value associated with taking in the board's switches as inputs and then converting from binary to decimal (base 10)
   * [FSM Plus Display](https://github.com/Hardcaml-Mini-Course-at-Stevens/Course-Materials/tree/main/Week%205/FSMplusDisplay) - Displays the decimal (base 10) values of the counter on both the anodes and LED's while maintaining the traffic light controller FSM behavior as well
* [Lecture Recording (to be provided later)]()
